## The Deployment Nightmare

You've built an amazing machine learning project. The model works. The code is clean. Your GitHub repo is pristine.

Then reality hits: **Where do I deploy this?**

You Google. Stack Overflow explodes with "Just use Docker!" and "Deploy to AWS!" You're paralyzed. Do you need a Kubernetes cluster? Is Vercel overkill for ML? Will Hugging Face Spaces auto-scale? Can Streamlit Cloud handle your API calls?

This was me six months ago. I deployed the same MediOps project to three different platforms, broke it twice, and finally cracked the code.

Here's everything I learned so you don't have to suffer.

---

## The Myth: "There's a One-Size-Fits-All Platform"

**Wrong.** The right platform depends entirely on what you're building.

Let me be brutally honest: I've deployed portfolio projects on all three. Some were disasters. Some were magical. Here's the truth about each.

## Vercel: For Web Apps That Look Like Magic

**Best for:** React frontends, Next.js apps, portfolio projects that need to impress

Vercel is your golden ticket if you're building a beautiful dashboard or interactive demo. It's fast, your custom domain is two clicks away, and deploys feel instantaneous.

### The Good

- **Blazingly fast deployments** (git push → live in 60 seconds)
- **Custom domain is trivial** (madhav-portfolio.com)
- **Edge functions** let you run backend logic at the edge
- **Environment variables** are encrypted and easy to manage
- **Free tier is genuinely generous** (100GB bandwidth/month)
- **Gorgeous deployment UI** that makes you feel professional

### The Gotchas

- **Cold starts hurt.** First request to a serverless function = slow
- **Running ML models is tricky.** Large model files exceed Vercel's 50MB limit per function
- **Not ideal for data science demos.** Vercel is for web apps, not Jupyter notebooks
- **API rate limits can bite you.** If you call a Groq API for inference, you'll hit limits fast

### My Use Case

I deployed my portfolio website and a Next.js frontend on Vercel. It's *stunning*. But when I tried running inference there? Disaster. Models timed out.

**My advice:** Use Vercel for your portfolio website, UI dashboards, and Next.js frontends. Not for heavy ML inference.

## Hugging Face Spaces: For ML Models & Gradio Apps

**Best for:** Deploying ML models, Streamlit apps, Gradio interfaces, demo apps

Hugging Face Spaces is built *for* machine learning engineers. It's where your models live, where recruiters expect to see your demos, and where inference just *works*.

### The Good

- **Model hosting is seamless.** Upload your model once, it's available forever
- **Streamlit + Gradio native support.** No extra configuration
- **Free GPU access.** Yes, really. Free GPUs for inference
- **Perfect portfolio platform.** Recruiters know Hugging Face
- **Cold starts are fast.** They've optimized for ML workflows
- **Private repos available.** Keep your WIP stuff private
- **Community is incredible.** People actually use Spaces as portfolio pieces

### The Gotchas

- **Compute limits are real.** Free tier = limited CPU/memory
- **Custom domains cost extra.** ($12/month for private Space URLs)
- **Overkill for simple web apps.** Why deploy a blog here?
- **Can be slower than Vercel for pure web content.** Spaces prioritize compute over speed

### My Use Case

I deployed MediOps on Hugging Face Spaces. The X-ray upload, inference, and GradCAM visualization? Butter smooth. Recruiters immediately recognized it as a serious project.

**My advice:** Use HF Spaces for ML models, medical imaging apps, data science demos. It's your default for portfolio ML projects.

## Streamlit Cloud: For Rapid Prototyping & Interactive Dashboards

**Best for:** Dashboards, exploratory data apps, internal tools, quick prototypes

Streamlit Cloud is the fast lane. You write Python, commit to GitHub, and it deploys. No HTML. No JavaScript. No Docker. Pure Python.

### The Good

- **Dead simple setup.** Write Python, push to GitHub, done
- **Interactivity feels native.** Sliders, buttons, dataframes just work
- **Perfect for dashboards.** The Tidy Rabbit dashboard lives here
- **Free tier is powerful.** One free app, unlimited viewers
- **Python-first workflow.** You write *only* Python
- **Real-time reloading.** Edit code, refresh browser, changes live
- **Great for demo day.** Show off a working prototype in minutes

### The Gotchas

- **Cold starts are slow.** 30-60 second spin-up time on free tier
- **Memory limits are tight.** Can't load 10GB models
- **Rerun on every interaction.** Page refreshes on every button click (performance hit)
- **State management is weird.** Session state takes getting used to
- **Less impressive for recruiters.** (vs. polished web apps)
- **Caching is essential or you'll timeout.** Must optimize hard

### My Use Case

The Tidy Rabbit dashboard runs on Streamlit Cloud. Why? Because it's 1,492 recyclers, real-time filters, and interactive maps—all pure Python. In 2 hours, I had a production-grade analytics platform live.

**My advice:** Use Streamlit for dashboards, data apps, and internal tools. It's magic for rapid iteration. But don't expect a polished, high-traffic experience.

## The Decision Matrix: Which Platform for What?

| Project Type | Best Platform | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Portfolio website | Vercel | Fast, pretty, shows web skills |
| ML model demo | Hugging Face Spaces | Built for ML, free GPUs |
| Interactive dashboard | Streamlit Cloud | Python-only, rapid iteration |
| Real-time analytics | Streamlit Cloud | Live updates, Plotly charts |
| Medical imaging app | Hugging Face Spaces | GPU support, serious vibe |
| Complex web app | Vercel | Full Next.js power |
| Quick prototype | Streamlit Cloud | Deploy in hours |

## The Real Talk: Deployment Failures I Had

### Failure 1: MediOps on Vercel

I tried hosting MediOps inference on Vercel. The model file was 450MB. Vercel's limit? 50MB per function.

**What I learned:** Serverless ≠ ML-friendly. Use Hugging Face for heavy models.

### Failure 2: Streamlit Dashboard With 10GB Data

My first Tidy Rabbit dashboard tried loading the entire PostgreSQL database. Memory issues. Timeouts. Unhappy users.

**What I learned:** Streamlit needs aggressive caching and filtering. Cache query results, paginate data, optimize like hell.

### Failure 3: Portfolio on Hugging Face Spaces

I uploaded my portfolio website as a Space. It *technically* worked but looked clunky. Spaces aren't for static sites.

**What I learned:** Match tool to use case. Spaces = interactive ML apps. Not blogs.

---

## My Deployment Strategy Now

**Portfolio website:** Vercel  
**ML models & demos:** Hugging Face Spaces  
**Dashboards & data apps:** Streamlit Cloud  
**APIs & heavy compute:** Would use Railway or Render (not free, but worth it)

---

## Cold Starts: The Performance Monster

**Cold starts kill user experience.** First request takes 30-60 seconds. Subsequent requests? 1-2 seconds.

**How to survive:**
- **Streamlit:** Use `@st.cache_resource` to load models once
- **Hugging Face:** CPU inference is fast; GPU cold starts are brutal
- **Vercel:** Use Edge Functions sparingly; pre-warm with background jobs

---

## What I'd Do Differently

1. **Choose platform before building.** (Don't architect for Vercel then deploy on Streamlit)
2. **Test deployment early.** (Not the night before demo day)
3. **Optimize for cold starts.** (Every second counts for first impression)
4. **Monitor performance.** (See where users actually suffer)
5. **Have a backup platform.** (If Streamlit is down, Hugging Face isn't)

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Vercel = web magic.** Dazzle with speed and UI polish
- **Hugging Face = ML credibility.** Deploy models, impress recruiters
- **Streamlit = rapid iteration.** Dashboard in hours, not days
- **Pick the right tool for the job.** Mismatch = pain
- **Cold starts matter.** Optimize ruthlessly
- **Recruitment > optimization.** A working demo beats a perfect infra

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Streamlit Cloud** if you have a data app (easiest onboarding)
2. **Use Hugging Face Spaces** for ML models (credibility + GPUs)
3. **Deploy your portfolio on Vercel** (show web skills + polish)
4. **Monitor and optimize** (performance = user experience)
5. **Keep all three live.** (Recruiters check all three platforms)

Because shipping is half the battle. Shipping on the *right* platform is the other half.
