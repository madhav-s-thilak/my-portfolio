## The Impossible Schedule

Monday morning, 9 AM. I'm at Tidy Rabbit standing up in a vendor meeting, presenting plastic recycling data. By 2 PM, I'm in class learning differential equations. At 11 PM, I'm fine-tuning a language model on Google Colab.

This was my life for six months. Intern at a climate-tech startup. Full-time student. Side project builder. Human.

People asked: *"How do you not burn out?"*

Honestly? I almost did. Twice.

But here's the thing: I didn't just survive. I *thrived*. And I figured out a system that let me do it without sacrificing sleep (entirely).

## The Context Switching Madness

Most interns have *one* focus. I had three:

1. **Tidy Rabbit** (Business Ops): Vendor research, EPR compliance, dashboard building
2. **BITS Pilani** (Academics): Courses, assignments, exams
3. **Portfolio** (Side Projects): MediOps, chess tutoring system, Streamlit dashboards

Each demanded full focus. Each had deadlines. Each screamed "I'm important!"

Context switching between them was brutal. My brain would:
- Optimize a Streamlit query (data engineering)
- Jump to a Python assignment (algorithms)
- Jump to vendor follow-ups (business writing)
- Back to debugging ML models

**I was exhausted before lunch.**

## What Almost Broke Me

### Week 3: The Perfect Storm

Dashboard deadline at Tidy Rabbit. Machine learning assignment due. Vendor emails piling up. Model wasn't converging. I hadn't slept properly in four days.

I remember staring at my laptop at 2 AM thinking: *"I can't do this."*

Everything felt urgent. Everything felt like it would break if I didn't fix it *right now*.

That's when I realized: **Not all urgent things are important.**

---

## The System That Actually Worked

I call it the **Three-Lane Strategy**. Imagine three parallel highways. Each has its own flow. Intersections are rare. And I never merge lanes mid-journey.

### Lane 1: Work (Tidy Rabbit)

**Sacred hours:** 9 AM - 6 PM, Monday-Friday

- Morning: Standup, team sync, planned work
- Afternoon: Focused work blocks (no meetings)
- Evening: Wrap-up, status updates

**Rules:**
- I don't code outside these hours (unless emergency)
- I don't check Slack after 6 PM
- I don't let "quick questions" snowball into hours of work

**The trick:** I batch things. Don't do vendor outreach throughout the day—block 2 hours Monday + Thursday. Don't check email constantly—check at 9 AM, noon, 3 PM, 5:30 PM. That's it.

### Lane 2: School (BITS)

**Sacred hours:** Class + 2-3 study blocks per week

- Classes are fixed (can't skip)
- Assignments get 1-2 focused sessions
- Exams get 1 week of prep, not last-minute cramming

**Rules:**
- Assignments due Friday? Do them Tuesday-Wednesday, not Thursday night
- Attend classes. (This saves 3x the study time later)
- Join study groups. (Others catch your blind spots)

**The trick:** Academics aren't going away. They're baseline. Don't fight them—plan around them.

### Lane 3: Portfolio (Side Projects)

**Sacred hours:** 7 PM - 11 PM, three nights per week (Wed, Fri, Sun)

This is where MediOps lives. This is where I build. This is *my* time.

**Rules:**
- I don't work on side projects during work/school hours
- I don't sacrifice sleep for them (more on this)
- I pick ONE project per month (not five)
- I ship something every 2 weeks (doesn't have to be perfect)

**The trick:** Ruthless prioritization. MediOps mattered most → it got my attention. Chess tutoring was fun but secondary → 20% of time. Experiment notebooks? Deprecated. Deleted.

---

## The Tools I Actually Used

### 1. Calendar Blocking (Non-Negotiable)

Google Calendar is my operating system. Every block is sacred.

- **Green:** Work (Tidy Rabbit)
- **Blue:** School (Classes, study)
- **Purple:** Side projects
- **Gray:** Exercise, sleep, buffer time

I see conflicts instantly. Over-booking? Impossible.

**Pro tip:** I color-code by importance too. High-stakes meetings? Bright red. Admin stuff? Light gray. My brain doesn't even blink at gray blocks.

### 2. Weekly Review (30 Minutes, Sunday Night)

Every Sunday, 7 PM: I do a review. What worked? What broke? What's next week?

**The template:**
- What got done? (Celebrate wins, however small)
- What didn't? (Why? Fix it or let it go)
- What's blocking me? (Identify obstacles)
- What's next week's priority? (Pick THREE)

This 30-minute session saved me from drowning. It's like a pressure release valve.

### 3. The Shutdown Ritual (Critical)

At 6 PM (work ends) and 11 PM (projects end), I do a "shutdown ritual":

- Write down what's left to do (externalize it)
- Commit to three things for tomorrow
- Close all work apps
- Step away from desk

**Why?** Your brain needs to KNOW you're not working anymore. Without ritual, you stay "partially working" all night. Exhausting.

### 4. Coffee (Strategic, Not Constant)

I drink coffee *strategically*, not throughout the day.

- One cup at 9 AM (kickoff)
- Maybe one at 2 PM (post-lunch slump)
- **Never after 5 PM.** (I need to sleep)

Over-caffeination kills sleep. Bad sleep kills everything else.

## The Real Productivity Hack: Say No

This sounds obvious but *nobody does it*.

During my internship, I was asked to:
- Lead a new project (too much)
- Join three clubs (said no)
- Mentor other interns (said no, later yes for one)
- Build additional dashboards (prioritized ruthlessly)

**My default word became "no"** (with explanations).

"Can you build a new feature for the dashboard?"  
*"Not this month. I'm focused on X. Let's revisit in December."*

"Want to join the AI club?"  
*"I'm maxed out. But I'm happy to guest speak next semester."*

Every "no" bought me 5 hours of focus. That focus built MediOps.

---

## The Sleep Non-Negotiable

This is the secret weapon nobody talks about.

I aimed for **7-8 hours every night.** Not "sometimes." Every night.

Why? Because:
- Bad sleep kills focus (and I need focus for three competing priorities)
- Bad sleep kills creativity (debugging ML models requires clarity)
- Bad sleep kills morale (business ops gets depressing without rest)

When sleep suffered, *everything* suffered. When sleep was protected, I could do the impossible.

**My sleep schedule:**
- Bed by 11:30 PM
- Alarm at 7 AM
- Zero phones in bed

Yes, this meant saying no to late-night hangouts. Yes, it felt restrictive. But it *enabled everything else*.

---

## Context-Switching Without Dying

Between work and projects, I had a 1-hour buffer. Here's what I did:

- 6-7 PM: **Decompression**
  - Walk outside (15 min)
  - Shower (15 min)
  - Eat dinner (30 min)
  - NO CODE, NO EMAILS

This buffer reset my brain. By 7 PM, I was ready to think like a side-project builder again.

Without this? I'd carry "work" brain into "project" time. Inefficient. Resentful.

---

## What I'd Do Differently

1. **Start with the system earlier.** (I fumbled for month 1-2)
2. **Protect sleep more fiercely.** (I learned this hard way)
3. **Pick fewer side projects.** (Four projects = one gets neglected)
4. **Batch ALL admin work.** (Email, Slack, messages: 4 times per day max)
5. **Celebrate wins weekly.** (I was always looking ahead, never backward)

---

## The Impact by Numbers

Over 6 months:

- **Tidy Rabbit:** Delivered 3 major projects (dashboard, automator, vendor intel)
- **BITS:** GPA maintained (didn't tank school)
- **Portfolio:** Built MediOps (chest X-ray AI), Chess tutoring system, 15+ experiments
- **Sanity:** Still here. Still sane. (Mostly)

Zero burnout. One great internship. One portfolio that impressed recruiters.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Context switching kills productivity.** Batch by lane (work/school/projects)
- **Calendar is law.** If it's not scheduled, it doesn't happen
- **Weekly review is your lifeline.** 30 minutes prevents drowning
- **Say no ruthlessly.** Every no buys you 5-10 hours of focus
- **Sleep is not optional.** It's infrastructure for everything else
- **Burnout is preventable, not heroic.** Glorifying exhaustion is stupid

---

## For Future Interns Reading This

You can have it all—work, school, portfolio, and sanity. But not without a system.

Don't believe the LinkedIn posts about sleeping 4 hours and crushing it. That's survivorship bias. The people sleeping 4 hours and burning out? They just don't post about it.

Build a system. Protect your time. Say no. Sleep. Ship.

Then watch recruiters get excited about someone who actually has *both* depth *and* balance.

**Struggling with balance? Build the system first, projects second. Everything else follows.**
